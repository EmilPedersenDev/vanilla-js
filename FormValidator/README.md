# Form Validator

This project is just a basic form validator. The submit button doesn't actual funcion
as the project doesn't have a backend connected to it. The main purpose of this project
was just to prove to myself that I knew enough about creating forms with HTML and CSS
and could put in the necessary JavaScript logic to turn the fields either green or red
based on whether the data that was input in was valid and met the specified requirements

# Converting the project to TypeScript

I will be returning to this project in a little while to see if I can convert it to a
TypeScript project.
