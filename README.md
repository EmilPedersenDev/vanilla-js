# About this Repository

The purpose of the projects in this repo are mainly for me to prove to myself that I still know
how to use basic JavaScript with any frameworks to make the frontend side easier or prettier.
That I can still use basic HTML and CSS to create a pretty looking website with really awesome
capabilities built just the basics that the JavaScript language has to offer.

You won't see any of these projects built with frameworks like React, Angualr or Vue. I wanted
to follow along with some of the awesome projects that I have seen built on Udemy courses as well
as a few other online course sites, build them with the basics of the web, and then try to
convert them to a TypeScript project if at all possible.

I'm really excited to be going through these projects. Building them in Vanilla JavaScript
and then converting them into TypeScript. Enjoy.

# Disclaimer

As I said above these projects are based on, and come from, some of the best online tutorials and
courses I was able to find. I am going through these courses on the respective platform, ie Udemy,
building out the projects along with the instructor; then trying to convert them all to TypeScript
on my own. Outside of the course or tutorial they are from.
